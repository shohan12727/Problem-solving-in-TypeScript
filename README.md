## What is the use of the keyof keyword in TypeScript? Provide an example.

- typeof is a keyword in typesript. With this we can check the type of a element- either is boolean, string, number.

console.log(typeof 42);

console.log(typeof "blubber");

console.log(typeof true);

## Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.?

These are keyword - with these we can assign a variable - any, unknown, never

- any: any value type we can assign with this, do not check type
- unknown: any value type we can assign with this, but must check type first.
- never: 'never' represent impossible value
